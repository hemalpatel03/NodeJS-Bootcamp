Problem 2: JSON Manipulation

 a) Define JSON and explain its importance in web development.

 Ans: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format used to exchange 
 data between a server and a client. It's easy for humans to read and write, and it's easy for machines 
 to parse and generate.

 b) Given a JSON data string: {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "hobbies": ["reading",
 "painting"]}, explain how you would extract the value of the "age" key.

 Ans: To extract the value of the "age" key from the JSON data:
         const age = jsonObject.age;

 c) How would you convert the following object into a JSON data string? {"title": "Book", "pages":
 200}

 Ans: To convert an object into a JSON data string:
        const jsonString = JSON.stringify({"title": "Book", "pages": 200});
